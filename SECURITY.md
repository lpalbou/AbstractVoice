# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in AbstractVoice, please **report it privately** and give us time to investigate and publish a fix.

Preferred channels:
- **Email**: `contact@abstractcore.ai`
- **GitHub**: Open a *private* Security Advisory (if available for the repository)

What to include (helps us reproduce and fix quickly):
- A clear description of the issue and its security impact
- Steps to reproduce (or a minimal proof-of-concept)
- Affected versions/commit SHA
- Your environment (OS, Python version) and any relevant dependency versions
- Any suggested mitigations or patches (optional)

## Coordinated disclosure

- Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for a suspected vulnerability.
- We’ll acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and coordinate a disclosure timeline once we understand scope and impact.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest released minor line when feasible (currently `0.6.x`). If you’re unsure whether your version is supported, report anyway.
