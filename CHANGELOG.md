## [0.4.5] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **üéØ CRITICAL FIX**: Voice switching now ACTUALLY loads different models instead of always falling back
  - **Root cause**: TTS engine was ignoring `preferred_model` parameter and always trying hardcoded priority order
  - **Solution**: Reordered model loading to try requested model FIRST, only fall back if it fails
  - **Result**: `/setvoice en.jenny` now loads jenny model, `/setvoice en.ek1` loads ek1 model, etc.
- **üí• Fixed Segmentation Faults**: Added proper memory cleanup when switching TTS models
  - **Root cause**: Old TTS models not cleaned up before loading new ones, causing memory conflicts
  - **Solution**: Added `cleanup()` method to `NonBlockingAudioPlayer` and proper deletion in `set_tts_model()`
  - **Result**: No more crashes when switching voices, especially with EK1 model

### Changed
- **Smart Model Loading Strategy**: Now tries requested model first, bulletproof fallback second
  1. **Try requested model** (if cached and compatible)
  2. **Try downloading requested model** (if not cached)
  3. **Only then fall back** to compatibility-first priority order
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio streams and TTS objects during voice switching

### Technical Details
- **TTS Engine**: `_load_with_simple_fallback()` now respects `preferred_model` parameter
- **Audio Player**: Added `cleanup()` method to prevent memory leaks
- **Voice Manager**: Enhanced `set_tts_model()` with proper resource cleanup

### User Experience
- ‚úÖ **Voice switching WORKS**: Different voices now sound genuinely different
- ‚úÖ **No crashes**: Segmentation faults eliminated during voice switching
- ‚úÖ **Memory stable**: No memory leaks or conflicts when changing voices
- ‚úÖ **Bulletproof fallback**: Still works reliably if requested voice fails

## [0.4.4] - 2025-10-19

### Added

  - **Jenny**: Different female speaker (US accent) - `en.jenny`
  - **EK1**: Male voice with British accent - `en.ek1`
  - **VCTK**: Multi-speaker dataset with various accents - `en.vctk`
  - **Tacotron2**: Reliable female voice (primary fallback) - `en.tacotron2`
- **üì¢ Real Voice Differences**: Each voice uses different speaker datasets, not just different engines
  - No more "all English voices sound the same" problem
  - Clear male vs female vs multi-speaker options
  - US vs British accent variants

### Fixed
- **üîß Voice Switching Actually Works**: Fixed voice catalog synchronization
  - Updated `VOICE_CATALOG` to match `simple_model_manager.py` definitions

  - Fallback priority: `tacotron2` ‚Üí `jenny` ‚Üí `ek1` ‚Üí `vctk` ‚Üí others
  - Smart espeak detection still skips incompatible models
  - Zero breaking changes to installation robustness

### Technical Details

## [0.4.3] - 2025-10-19

### Fixed
- **üéØ MAJOR UX FIX**: Completely rewrote TTS model selection logic to be bulletproof

## [0.1.9] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **New Method**: `VoiceManager.set_tts_model()` - Change TTS model dynamically
  - Switch between VITS, fast_pitch, glow-tts, tacotron2-DDC at runtime
  - No need to reinitialize VoiceManager
  - Example: `vm.set_tts_model("tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits")`
- **New REPL Command**: `/tts_model <model>` - Change TTS model from CLI
  - Shortcuts: vits, fast_pitch, glow-tts, tacotron2-DDC

- **Comprehensive Installation Guide** for espeak-ng
  - macOS (Homebrew), Linux (apt/yum), Windows (conda/chocolatey/installer)
  - Clear instructions in README for all platforms
- **Automatic Model Selection** based on espeak-ng availability
  - Automatically uses VITS if espeak-ng is installed (best quality)
  - Gracefully falls back to fast_pitch if espeak-ng is missing
  - User-friendly message with installation instructions on fallback

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed speed parameter affecting pitch - now uses librosa time-stretching
  - Speed changes no longer alter voice pitch (preserves naturalness)
  - Proper time-stretching algorithm applied to all audio chunks
  - Speed parameter now works as expected: 1.2x = 20% faster with same pitch
  - Works with both `speak(speed=X)` and `set_speed(X)` methods
  - Range: 0.5x (half speed) to 2.0x (double speed)
- **Fixed**: Silenced coqpit deserialization warnings (Type mismatch in FastPitchConfig)
  - No more technical warnings during startup
  - Clean user experience

### Changed
- **Changed default TTS model to VITS (best quality, with auto-fallback)**
  - VITS provides significantly better voice quality than fast_pitch/glow-tts/tacotron2
  - Uses phoneme-based synthesis for natural prosody and intonation
  - Requires espeak-ng (available via package managers on all platforms)
  - Automatic fallback to fast_pitch if espeak-ng not found
  - Detection is automatic - no configuration needed
- **Honest about voice quality trade-offs in all documentation:**
  - VITS (best): Natural prosody, emotional expression, requires espeak-ng
  - fast_pitch: Good quality, works everywhere, no dependencies
  - glow-tts: Alternative fallback, similar to fast_pitch
  - tacotron2-DDC: Legacy model, slower
- **Updated all documentation** to reflect quality rankings and installation
- Added `librosa>=0.10.0` dependency for audio time-stretching (pure Python)
- Silenced pkg_resources deprecation warning from jieba dependency

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from abstractvoice import VoiceManager

# Automatic: Uses VITS if espeak-ng available, fast_pitch otherwise
vm = VoiceManager()

# Explicit: Force a specific model
vm = VoiceManager(tts_model="tts_models/en/ljspeech/fast_pitch")

# Dynamic: Change model at runtime
vm.set_tts_model("tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits")

# Speed control (pitch preserved)
vm.set_speed(1.2)  # 20% faster
vm.speak("Test", speed=1.5)  # 50% faster for this speech only
```
