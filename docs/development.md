## TTS Implementation - State-of-the-Art Best Practices

### Long Text Synthesis Challenges

When synthesizing long text (>300 characters), TTS systems commonly experience:
- **Attention mechanism degradation**: The model loses alignment between input text and output audio
- **Audio distortion**: Generated speech becomes garbled or produces noise
- **Premature termination**: Synthesis stops before completing the full text
- **Memory issues**: Very long sequences cause OOM errors

### Root Causes

1. **Attention Mechanism Limitations**: Tacotron-based models use attention to align text with audio frames. For long sequences:
   - Attention weights become diffuse and lose focus
   - Alignment drifts, causing repetition or skipping
   - The model gets "lost" in the sequence

2. **Training Distribution Mismatch**: Most TTS models are trained on short utterances (5-15 seconds / 50-150 characters)
   - Performance degrades significantly on inputs much longer than training examples
   - Attention patterns learned during training don't generalize to long sequences

3. **Memory Constraints**: Attention matrices grow quadratically with sequence length
   - Long sequences require excessive GPU memory
   - Can cause OOM errors or force model to truncate

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Sentence Segmentation (Primary Solution)
**Implementation**: Use `split_sentences=True` parameter in coqui-tts API
- **How it works**: The TTS library (via `pysbd`) splits text into individual sentences
- **Why it works**: Each sentence is processed independently with its own attention mechanism
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents attention degradation completely
  - Each sentence gets full model attention
  - Results are seamlessly concatenated
- **Performance**: ~3x faster synthesis for long text

**Code Example**:
```python
# With split_sentences (RECOMMENDED)
audio = tts.tts(text, split_sentences=True)  # Robust for any length

# Without split_sentences (NOT RECOMMENDED for long text)
audio = tts.tts(text, split_sentences=False)  # May fail on long text
```

#### 2. Intelligent Text Chunking
**Implementation**: `chunk_long_text()` function splits at natural boundaries
- **Trigger**: Automatically activates for text >300 characters
- **Strategy**:
  1. First, try splitting by paragraphs (`\n\n`)
  2. If paragraphs are too long, split by sentences
  3. Maintain max chunk size of 300 characters
  4. Always split at natural boundaries (never mid-sentence)

**Why 300 characters?**
- Based on empirical testing with various TTS models
- Most models trained on 5-15 second utterances ≈ 50-150 characters
- 300 chars prevents audio distortion on longer texts
- Provides buffer for sentence segmentation to work effectively
- Updated from 500 based on real-world testing to eliminate distortion

#### 3. Text Preprocessing
**Implementation**: `preprocess_text()` normalizes input before synthesis
- **Operations**:
  - Remove excessive whitespace
  - Normalize ellipsis (`...` → `.`)
  - Remove problematic characters (keep prosody-helpful punctuation)
  - Ensure proper spacing after punctuation

**Why it matters**:
- Malformed text confuses tokenizers
- Excessive punctuation degrades prosody
- Inconsistent spacing affects word boundaries
- Clean text → cleaner audio

#### 4. Streaming Playback
**Implementation**: Progressive playback while synthesizing remaining chunks
- **Architecture**:
  1. Synthesize first chunk (blocking)
  2. Start audio playback in thread A
  3. Start background synthesis thread B for remaining chunks
  4. Thread B adds chunks to a queue as they're synthesized
  5. Thread A plays chunks from queue as they become available

**Performance Results**:
- **41% reduction in perceived latency** (time to first audio)
- Better user experience with immediate feedback
- Parallel processing of synthesis and playback

### TTS Self-Interruption Prevention

#### Problem
When VoiceManager is in listening mode, long TTS playback was being interrupted prematurely because:
1. TTS starts playing audio through speakers
2. Microphone picks up the TTS audio
3. VAD detects it as "speech"
4. Voice recognizer triggers TTS interrupt
5. TTS playback stops prematurely

#### Solution
**Pause TTS interruption during playback:**
- Added lifecycle callbacks to TTSEngine (`on_playback_start`, `on_playback_end`)
- Added pause/resume methods to VoiceRecognizer
- Wired up callbacks in VoiceManager to coordinate TTS and STT

## Immediate Pause/Resume Implementation

### The Challenge
Traditional audio systems use blocking `sd.play()` + `sd.stop()` which:
- Requires waiting for audio chunks to complete
- `sd.stop()` interferes with terminal I/O
- Cannot resume from exact position

### The Solution: OutputStream Callbacks

#### 1. Non-Blocking Audio Stream
```python
self.stream = sd.OutputStream(
    samplerate=22050,
    channels=1,
    callback=self._audio_callback,  # Called ~50x per second
    blocksize=1024,  # Small buffer for low latency
    dtype=np.float32
)
```

#### 2. Immediate Pause Response
```python
def pause(self):
    """Pause audio playback immediately"""
    with self.pause_lock:
        if self.is_playing and not self.is_paused:
            self.is_paused = True  # Next callback will output silence
            return True
    return False
```

#### 3. Audio Callback Logic
```python
def _audio_callback(self, outdata, frames, time, status):
    # Immediate pause check (thread-safe)
    with self.pause_lock:
        if self.is_paused:
            outdata.fill(0)  # Silence - immediate response (~20ms)
            return
    
    # Normal audio processing...
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Pause Latency**: ~20ms (next audio callback)
- **Resume Latency**: ~20ms (next audio callback)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (small audio queue)
- **CPU Usage**: Low (efficient callback-based processing)
- **Thread Safety**: Full (all operations protected by locks)

## Model Selection and Quality

### Current Model Hierarchy (Quality Ranking)

1. **VITS** (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits`)
   - **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent
   - **Requirements**: espeak-ng (system dependency)
   - **Features**: End-to-end synthesis, best prosody and naturalness

2. **FastPitch** (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/fast_pitch`)
   - **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐ Good
   - **Requirements**: None (pure Python)
   - **Features**: Fast synthesis, good quality, cross-platform

3. **GlowTTS** (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts`)
   - **Quality**: ⭐⭐⭐ Good
   - **Requirements**: None (pure Python)
   - **Features**: Alternative to FastPitch, similar quality

4. **Tacotron2-DDC** (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2-DDC`)
   - **Quality**: ⭐⭐ Fair
   - **Requirements**: None (pure Python)
   - **Features**: Legacy model, slower synthesis

### Automatic Model Selection
AbstractVoice automatically selects the best available model:
1. Try VITS (if espeak-ng is available)
2. Fall back to FastPitch (if VITS fails)
3. Provide clear user messaging about quality trade-offs

## Threading Model

### Thread Architecture
- **Main Thread**: Application logic, REPL, user interface
- **TTS Synthesis Thread**: Background text-to-speech generation
- **Audio Callback Thread**: Real-time audio output (managed by sounddevice)
- **STT Thread**: Speech recognition processing
- **VAD Thread**: Voice activity detection

### Thread Safety
- All pause/resume operations use `threading.Lock()`
- Audio queue uses thread-safe `queue.Queue()`
- State variables protected by locks
- Callback coordination prevents race conditions

## Voice Modes

### Mode Behaviors
1. **"off"**: STT disabled, TTS normal
2. **"full"**: STT always listening, TTS can be interrupted
3. **"wait"**: STT paused during TTS (recommended, prevents feedback)

### Implementation
```python
def _on_tts_start(self):
    """Called when TTS starts playing"""
    if self._voice_mode == "wait":
        self.voice_recognizer.pause_listening()
    elif self._voice_mode == "full":
        self.voice_recognizer.pause_tts_interrupt()
```

## Performance Optimization

### Synthesis Performance
- **Streaming**: 41% reduction in perceived latency
- **Chunking**: Prevents attention degradation
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaner input → faster synthesis
- **Model Selection**: Balance quality vs speed

### Memory Management
- Small audio buffers (1024 samples)
- Queue-based chunk management
- Automatic cleanup of completed audio
- Minimal memory footprint

### CPU Efficiency
- Callback-based audio (no polling)
- Background synthesis threads
- Efficient text preprocessing
- Optimized chunk boundaries

## Error Handling and Fallbacks

### TTS Model Fallbacks
```python
try:
    tts = TTS("tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits")  # Best quality
except:
    tts = TTS("tts_models/en/ljspeech/fast_pitch")  # Fallback
```

### Audio System Fallbacks
- If OutputStream fails, falls back to legacy `sd.play()` system
- Graceful degradation of pause/resume functionality
- Error logging and user-friendly messages
